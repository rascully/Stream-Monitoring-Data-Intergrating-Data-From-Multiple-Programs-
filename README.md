#Integrating Stream Habitat Metrics 
This repository contains the code to integrate stream habitat metrics from three stream habitat monitoring programs EPA National Aquatic Resources Surveys (NARS), BLM Aquatic Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring, and USFS Aquatic and Riparian Effective Monitoring Program (AREMP). We integrate data based on the data exchange specifications in the [Stream Monitoring Data Exchange Specifications repository](https://github.com/rascully/Stream-Monitoring-Data-Exchange-Specifications). 

#Purpose
Improving data sharing will enable timely access to data, enhance data quality, and create clear channels for better management decisions. Healthy aquatic habitat is critical to fishes, aquatic species, and water quality. Across the US, long-term, large-scale stream habitat monitoring programs collect data for their specific objectives and within their jurisdictional boundaries. Streams cross jurisdictional boundaries and face unprecedented pressure from changing climate, multi-use public lands, and development. To meet these stressors, we integrate data from multiple sources to create a data set of stream metrics across jurisdictional boundaries. We focus on integrating data from the EPA National Aquatic Resources Surveys (NARS), BLM Aquatic Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring, and USFS Aquatic and Riparian Effective Monitoring Program (AREMP). This code integrates a subset of metrics collected on public lands in the Western United States and documents metadata in MonitoringResources.org based on the data exchange specifications and crosswalks outlined in the [Stream Monitoring Data Exchange Specifications repository](https://github.com/rascully/Stream-Monitoring-Data-Exchange-Specifications). 


#Inputs 
We built the intergrated data set based on this workflow with the following inputs:  
<ul>
<li>Origian data sets from each program. We documented data set metadata in documented in [ScienceBase](www.sciencebase.gov) </li>
<li>
<li>[Field Crosswalk]()</li>
<li>[MonitoringResources.org Methods](MonitoringResources.org)</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>


#Outputs 
The code produces multiple outputs stored in the Data file:  

We pre-process the AREMP and EPA NRSA data sets to flatten them and save the ouputs in the data file. 
<ul>
<li>[Tity AREMP Data Set]() </li>
<li>[Tity NRSA Data Set]()</li>
</ul>

We intergrated a subset of metrics and metadata from the four programs the following data files are produced and saved in the data file of this respository and uploaded to [ScienceBase](). 
<ul>
<li>Unique Locations-this is a list of the unique location of data collection from the three programs included in the intergrated data sets</li>
<li>Integrated Data Set- the data set bulit using the data[Stream Monitoring Data Exchange Specifications](https://github.com/rascully/Stream-Monitoring-Data-Exchange-Specifications)</li>
<li>Flat Integrated Data Set- a flat file of the integrated data sets.  </li>
