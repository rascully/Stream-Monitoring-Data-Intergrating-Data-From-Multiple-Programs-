    "Improving data sharing will enable timely access to data, enhance the quality of data, and create clear channels for better management decisions.  Healthy aquatic habitat is critical to fishes, aquatic species, and water quality. Across the country long term, large scale stream habitat monitoring programs collect data for their specific objectives and within their jurisdictional boundaries.  Streams cross jurisdictional boundaries and face unprecedented pressure from changing climate, multi-use public lands, and development. To meet these stressors, we need a way to ingratiate data from multiple sources to create indicators of stream conditions across jurisdictional boundaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Partnership (PNAMP) with the support of the USGS faciliated a working group to describe data exchange specifications and a controlled vocabulary for sharing stream habitat metrics and metadata based on the Darwin Core standards. The full write up is published here!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook we use those data exchange specifications and a cross walk from EPA National Aquatic Resources Surveys (NARS); BLM Aquatic Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM); and USFS Aquatic and Riparian Effective Monitoring Program (AREMP) and Pacfish/Infish Biological Opinion Effectiveness Monitoring Program (PIBO) to the controlled vocabulary to build an data set. This data set intergrates metrics and site metadata from three of the four progrmas with published data sets, EPA NRSA, BLM AIM, and USFS AREMP. We also link metrics to a machine readable method documentation in MonitoringResources.org an online, publicly accessible suite of information and tools for natural resource monitoring programs, focusing on documentation of data collection and analysis methods. \n",

    "To intergrate stream habitat metrics from mutiple sources there needs to be a set of guidines and rules. Data exchange specifications are a set of guidelines and rules for using and combining information. Rigorous data exchange specifications support reuse, promote interoperability, and reduce data integration costs (Morris and Frechette 2008, Hamm 2019). The Stream Monitoring Habitat Data Exchange Specifications are a standard for exchanging metric-level habitat data based on the Darwin Core principles outlined by Wieczorek et al. in 2012. The Darwin Core standard is maintained at the GitHub repository https://github.com/tdwg/dwc. \n",

Using the data dictionary, cross walk and data schema we write R code to build one data set integrating data from the three programs with accessible data sets. We publish the data set on ScienceBase and is searchable, machine readable and accessible for download of via and API so it can be used in we portals, mapping tools and programing packages (R and Python (Klein et.
